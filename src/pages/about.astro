  <h2>Our Process</h2>
  <p>
    We don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all solution. Your needs and tastes are unique. So
    the process we follow to make your home the functional and beautiful home you have in
    mind is determined after a face-to-face meeting. We’ll ask questions, discuss ideas,
    brain storm, discuss a budget that works for you, explore all possibilities. We’ll
    determine what your starting point is and begin a process that will ultimately end
    with your design goals becoming a reality.
